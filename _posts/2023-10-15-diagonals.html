            <h2>Participation is crucial for understanding</h2>
            <p>Interviews and market research are great and all, but just digging in and becoming every persona possible is also a great tool for ideation and understanding.
               Plus NFTs are fun and this is the perfect excuse to make art and learn about the attention economy. 
            </p>
            <h2>The plan</h2>
            <p>Try to avoid making a plan, go with the flow and let the experience inform. Just be cool, pay attention and make it up as you go. Collect as much alpha as possible and apply it to <a href="/xrpcafe">xrp.cafe</a>.</p>
            <h2>The art</h2>
            <p>Three thousand mostly generative artworks based on a variety of tropes and themes. Once you start to think about art production in a systematic way a lot of really 
                interesting opportunities surface. So much of the creative process is accidental, the generative process amplifies these happy accidents. It really is a great tool for discovery.</p>
