            <h2>Participation is crucial</h2>
            <p>As the UX specialist at <a href="/xrpcafe">xrp.cafe</a>, I believe it's crucial to fully immerse myself in the creator's journey. While asking questions and conducting research are essential, truly understanding and innovating—creating "the thing people didn't know they wanted"—demands a deeper engagement with the product. These generative artworks are intended to help me anticipate creators' needs and explore new possibilities with NFTs.</p>
